  This project is composed of :

  - a proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in 
    "A formalization of Stalmarck's algorithm in COQ" TPHOLs2000.

  - an implementation of the algorithm. With respect to the paper,
    this implementation is completely functional and can be used inside
    Coq.

  - a reflected tactic `Stalt`, that uses the extracted code to compute
    an execution trace, the trace checker is then called inside Coq.

  See `algoRun.v` for examples how to use stalmarck inside Coq

  See `StalTac_ex.v` for examples how to use the reflected tactic.

  WARNING: Stalmarck's method is patented and should not be used for commercial
  applications without the agreement of Prover Technology.
