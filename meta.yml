  ## Documentation

  This project is composed of:

  - A Coq proof of correctness of the algorithm, as described in the paper
    [A Formalization of Stålmarck's Algorithm in Coq][paper-link], published
    in the proceedings of TPHOLs 2000.
  - an implementation of the algorithm. With respect to the paper, this
    implementation is completely functional and can be used inside Coq.
  - A reflected Coq tactic `staltac` that uses the extracted code to compute
    an execution trace; the trace checker is then called inside Coq.
  - A standalone checker program `stalmarck` which takes as input a formula in
    textual format and reports whether it can be certified as a tautology.

  See `algoRun.v` for examples how to use the algorithm inside Coq, and
  see `StalTac_ex.v` for examples how to use the reflected tactic.
