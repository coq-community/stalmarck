This directory builds a standalone Tautology Checker using 
the code extracted in the upper directory.

Syntax: 

./stalmarck <level> <file> 

where: 

<level> is an integer controling depth of dilemma. Usual values: 
0: does only propagation 
1: dilemma upon one variable at the same time
2: dilamma can be done upon two variables at the same time. 
More than 2 may be *very* long. 

<file> is the file containing the boolean formula. 
Syntax of such a file: 

Comments	//  (reading is suspended until the end of the line)
Variable	any alphanumeric chain plus the character _
Not		~
And		&
Or		#
Implication	->
Equivalence	<->
Parenthesis	( ) 
True value	<T>
False value	<F>

Priority of connectives , from lower to higher
<-> ->  (associate to the right)
# 	(associate to the left)
&       (associate to the left)
~

The only interesting output is "Tautology" (and exit code 0). 
The other output is "Don't know" (exit code 1): either the formula is not 
a tautology, either it is one but the program cannot conclude 
(insufficient level).


One example of test (ztwaalf1_be) is included.
