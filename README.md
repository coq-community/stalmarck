A two-level approach to prove tautologies using Stålmarck's algorithm in Coq.


More details about the project can be found in the paper
[Formalizing Stålmarck's Algorithm in Coq](https://www.irif.fr/~letouzey/download/stalmarck.ps.gz).

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Stalmarck
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-stalmarck
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/stalmarck
cd stalmarck
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```

After installation, the included modules are available under
the `Stalmarck` namespace.


## Documentation

This project is composed of:

- a proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in 
  "A Formalization of Stålmarck's Algorithm in Coq", TPHOLs2000.

- an implementation of the algorithm. With respect to the paper,
  this implementation is completely functional and can be used inside
  Coq.

- a reflected tactic `staltac`, that uses the extracted code to compute
  an execution trace, the trace checker is then called inside Coq.

See `algoRun.v` for examples how to use the algorithm inside Coq.

See `StalTac_ex.v` for examples how to use the reflected tactic.

WARNING: Stålmarck's method is patented and should not be used for commercial
applications without the agreement of Prover Technology.
